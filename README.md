So,I made a website called Banking System(Web Development).
Over here u can transfer money within the another bank account.

Language used are:

For Frontend:-HTML,CSS,Javascript.
For Backend:-php,MySQL(Database).

U need a wamp server because u can't run your php code in  browser.

And,I wanna thank Spark's Foundation for giving me the opporunity to work
with them and also I learned a lot of new things throughout this internship.
